# Recommended Tools

## 1. Introduction

This handout is meant as a guide for installing some of the tools that we will use during the course.

##### Warnings
* If you copy & paste from this document, make sure that the pasted text is exactly the same as the copied one (sometimes quote marks are changed)
* The only exception is when you see the text `YOURUSERNAME`: be sure to replace it with your actual user name!
* If you change any settings in Windows, you need to restart your command prompt (CMD) for the changes to take effect


## 2. Important Stuff
### 2.1 A Programming Editor
A good **programming editor**, such as [Atom](http://atom.io), [Sublime](http://sublimetext.com), [TextMate](http://macromates.com) (Mac only), [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org) (Windows only) or one of your own choice, is essential. It helps if it supports syntax highlighting for **Turtle** and/or **SPARQL**.

### 2.2 Java
Make sure that you have Java, and your Java version is up to date.

Install JDK version 8u101 for your platform from:

<http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html>

Running `java -version` in your terminal/command prompt should give:

```
java version "1.8.0_101"
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_101-b13)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.101-b13, mixed mode)
```

### 2.3 Python
A working version of **Python**, preferably somewhat close to 2.7.12 (but not 2.6 or 3.x) for your platform of choice.

* Check what version you have by running `python --version` in a terminal (or command prompt) window

**NB:** if you are an Anaconda user, and you're happy with it (are you?), you should replace all occurrences of `pip` below with the corresponding `conda` command. 

If needed:
* Conda users can install Python 2.7 by running `conda install python=2.7` in the Terminal.
* Windows users can go to <https://www.python.org> to download it.  
  **NB**: make sure to enable the 'Add Python.exe to path' option during installation.
* Linux users should use the package manager of their system (e.g. `sudo apt-get install python`)
* MacOS comes with a pre-installed version, but you may consider using [Homebrew](http://brew.sh) to install a clean and up-to-date version.
  - Start the Terminal application
  - Run `ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"` from the terminal
  - Then run `brew update` and `brew doctor`
  - Run `brew install python`

### 2.4 Programming Libraries
(For the lab session you may want to skip to section 3)

It is not usually a good idea to create and manipulate machine-interpretable files by hand. A good programming library for Linked Data is a real benefit.

Depending on your preferred programming language, examples are:

* [RDFLib](https://rdflib.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), for Python. Simply `pip install rdflib`
* [Jena](http://jena.apache.org) for Java.
* [EasyRDF](http://www.easyrdf.org) for PHP (but don't, oh, please)
* [rdflib.js](https://github.com/linkeddata/rdflib.js) for JavaScript
* [Redland](http://librdf.org) for C

## 3. The **Protégé** Ontology Editor

There are several RDF and OWL editors that you could use (apart from your favourite text-based editor). The main contenders are [Protégé](http://protege.stanford.edu) and [TopBraid Composer](http://www.topquadrant.com/downloads/topbraid-composer-install/).

We advise you to use Protégé for the assignments in Week 3.

* **Protégé** is a stand-alone editor that is very much tailored towards OWL ontology editing.
* It allows you to define OWL axioms using an abstract syntax (Manchester Syntax),
* but it is less transparent if you're interested in knowing what the syntactic RDF representation looks like. This may lead to confusing situations where it is unclear e.g. in what namespace you have defined your classes, instances, etc.  
* Protégé does support all major OWL2 DL reasoners (Fact++, Hermit and Pellet) and is thus quite powerful with respect to inferencing.

### Installing Protégé

* Download the the 5.0.0 version from GitHub: <https://github.com/protegeproject/protege-distribution/releases/tag/protege-5.0.0> 
* Install the Pellet plugin from within Protege, but if that doesn't work...
  * Download the **Pellet** reasoner from <https://github.com/Complexible/pellet/archive/master.zip> and place the `com.clarkparsia.protege.plugin.pellet.jar` file (from `pellet/protege/plugin/`) in the `plugins` directory of your **Protégé** installation.
    * On MacOS, you should right-click (ctrl-click) `Protégé.app`, and select "Show Package Contents". You should put the Pellet jar file in the `Contents/Java/plugins` folder.
* To run it:
  * The Windows installer should produce an icon for you, otherwise you will need to run the `run.bat` (or similar) script in the Protégé directory.
  * On Linux, you should run the `run.sh` script in the Protégé directory
  * On MacOS, you should run the `Protégé.app` application in the Protégé directory
* Make sure that the **Pellet** reasoner can be seen in the **Reasoner** menu of the Protégé application window.



## 4 The **Stardog** triple store (version 4 or higher):

Stardog is a reasoning-enabled database for Linked Data and ontologies.

* Apply for Community Edition license at <http://stardog.com> (or a 30-day evaluation)
* You will receive an email with a link to the download, and a license file.
* **NB**: Stardog may require a Java JDK to be installed on your system (not just a JRE, otherwise it will probably not work). Try getting it working without first installing Java. If it complains about it, install a recent JDK from Java.com

Official installation instructions can be found at <http://docs.stardog.com/#_quick_start_guide>

#### 4.1 Windows
One way to get it running:

* Move or copy the unzipped directory `stardog-4.1.3` to your `Documents` folder. You now have a directory called `C:\Users\YOURUSERNAME\Documents\stardog-4.1.3` (where YOURUSERNAME is your actual user name!)
* Create a `data` directory inside it, this is now `C:\Users\YOURUSERNAME\Documents\stardog-4.1.3\data`
* Copy the `stardog-license.bin` file to `C:\Users\YOURUSERNAME\Documents\stardog-4.1.3\data`
* Go to the Control Panel, and search for `environment variables`.
	* Create a system-wide variable called `STARDOG_HOME` and give it the value `C:\Users\YOURUSERNAME\Documents\stardog-4.1.3\data`.
	* Update the system-wide `PATH` variable by adding `C:\Users\YOURUSERNAME\Documents\stardog-4.1.3\bin`
* Start the Command Prompt, and type `stardog-admin.bat server start --disable-security` to start Stardog (you need to do this every time you have rebooted your system. If you want to manually stop the service, type `stardog-admin.bat server stop`)
* Open your browser, and go to <http://localhost:5820> the login details are `admin` and `admin`
* Whee!

Follow the next steps under **4.3**

Alternative installation instructions can be found at <http://docs.stardog.com/#_quick_start_guide>

#### 4.2 Linux/Mac
One way to get it running:

* Move or copy the unzipped directory `stardog-4.1.3` to your `Documents` folder. You now have a directory called `/Users/YOURUSERNAME/Documents/stardog-4.1.3`
* Create a `data` directory inside it, this is now `/Users/YOURUSERNAME/Documents/stardog-4.1.3/data`
* Copy the `stardog-license.bin` to `/Users/YOURUSERNAME/Documents/stardog-4.1.3/data`
* Open up a Terminal window, and type `open ~/.bash_profile`, this opens a TextEdit window on mac. Linux users will know what to do.
* Add the following lines anywhere in the file:

```
export STARDOG_HOME=/Users/YOURUSERNAME/Documents/stardog-4.1.3/data
export PATH=$PATH:/Users/YOURUSERNAME/Documents/stardog-4.1.3/bin
```
* Close the Terminal window, and open a new one
* Run the Stardog server via `stardog-admin server start --disable-security` (you need to do this every time you have rebooted your system. If you want to manually stop the service, type `stardog-admin server stop`)
* Open your browser, and go to <http://localhost:5820> the login details are `admin` and `admin`
* Whee!

Follow the next steps under **4.3**

#### 4.3 Starting and Stopping Stardog

To start: ``stardog-admin server start --disable-security`` (`stardog-admin.bat` on Windows)

To stop: ``stardog-admin server stop`` (`stardog-admin.bat` on Windows)

#### 4.3 All Platforms
* Go to <http://localhost:5820>, create a new Database called `tutorial` (you may need to login using *admin*/*admin*)
* Make sure to set reasoning to `SL` and "SameAs reasoning" to `FULL` otherwise leave the settings unchanged.
* Done!

## 5. The **Semantic Web** Tutorial

Once you have Python, Java and Stardog in place, you can try out the Semantic Web tutorial.

* Open up a Terminal or a Command Prompt window
* Change directory to e.g. your Documents directory (on Mac/Linux: `cd ~/Documents`, on Windows `cd C:\Users\YOURUSERNAME\Documents`)
* If you have GIT, you can "clone" the source code from Github. Type: `git clone https://github.com/RinkeHoekstra/semanticweb-web-application-tutorial.git web-application` to clone it into a folder called `web-application`
* Otherwise, download the zip file from <https://github.com/RinkeHoekstra/semanticweb-web-application-tutorial/archive/master.zip> and unzip to a folder called `web-application`
* Change directory to the newly created folder: `cd web-application`
* (**OPTIONAL**) Setup the virtualenv in the directory of this repository (`virtualenv .`)
* (**OPTIONAL**) Activate the virtualenv (`source bin/activate` on linux-like systems)
* Install the necessary packages (`pip install -r requirements.txt`)
* Check the Stardog SPARQL endpoint URL in the `TUTORIAL_REPOSITORY` variable in **both** `src/tutorial.py` and `src/static/js/tutorial.js`.  
* If you haven't done so, install **Stardog** and make sure it is running.
  * By default, the script assumes a Stardog database with the name 'tutorial' running at <http://localhost:5820/tutorial>.
  * The database should have `reasoning set to `SL` and "SameAs reasoning" to `FULL`.
	* Start your Stardog server with `stardog-admin server start --disable-security` (don't forget the `--disable-security` flag!). To stop Stardog, run `stardog-admin server stop`.
	* If you want to use a different name or location (i.e. not running on localhost, port 5820) you need to set the `TUTORIAL_REPOSITORY` variable in `src/tutorial.py`, and make appropriate modifications to the Stardog configuration.
* Run the tutorial from within the `src` directory by running `python tutorial.py`

Other information on how to run the tutorial can be found in the readme file on the GitHub page of the tutorial: <https://github.com/RinkeHoekstra/semantic-web-application-tutorial>.

#### The Ultimate Test: does it work?

Go to <http://localhost:5000> in your browser.

* In step 10,
  * type `Aspirin`, (this retrieves all matches for Aspirin from Linked Life Data)
  * select the link `Aspirin`,
  * and press the "Link" button. This pushes the RDF representation of LLD Aspirin to your Stardog instance.
  * Output should be 'Ok!'
* In step 11,
  * also type `Aspirin` (this will retrieve all matches for Aspirin from DBPedia),
  * select the link `Aspirin`,
  * and press the "Link" button.
  * Output should be 'Ok!'
* In step 12,
  * just press the "Link" button.
  * Output should be 'Ok!'
* Skip step 13
* In step 14,
   * just press the "Link" button.
   * Output should have two results, one from Linked Life Data, and one from DBPedia.

## 6. Optional but Recommended Tools

### 6.1 brwsr

[brwsr](https://github.com/Data2Semantics/brwsr) is a lightweight Linked Data browser, implemented in Python, that can be run as interface on top of a SPARQL endpoint, or just a list of files.

It supports:
* Rendering of all triples in which a resource plays a role (po, sp, and so)
* It is named-graph aware, allowing you to see what graph a triple belongs to
* It supports content negotiation for RDF clients
* It can browse external URIs, provided that they are published as Cool URIs (dereferencable URIs)
* It retrieves standard labels for URIs from preflabel.org

To install it, download the zip file or, clone it to a directory of your choice.

Open up a terminal, and change into that directory:

* create and activate a `virtualenv` if you so desire
* run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
* rename or copy `config-template.py` to `config.py`
* make appropriate settings in the file (documentation is inline)
* Start it with `python run.py` from within the `src` directory.

### 6.2 curl
`curl` is a simple command line utility for (amongst others) sending HTTP requests. You may need it for testing e.g. whether content negotiation works for your dataset.

You can also use an online service such as <http://hurl.it>.

* Windows users can download `curl` directly from <http://dl.uxnr.de/mirror/curl/curl-7.33.0-win64-ssl-sspi.zip>.  
  **NB**: curl is an executable (`.exe` file) that you should explicitly call on the **command prompt**. Double clicking in an explorer window will just briefly flash a command prompt window.  
  * Create a folder called 'curl' in the `C:\Program Files` directory,
  * copy `curl.exe` from the unzipped file to the `C:\Program Files\curl` directory,
  * then add the `C:\Program Files\curl` directory to the `PATH` system environment variable (in Control Panel, search for `environment variable`).
  * Edit the variable value, different directory names should be separated by a semicolon (`;`)
  * Start the Command Prompt (in Win 8/10 use the search) and type `curl.exe` to see whether it does anything.
* Linux typically comes shipped with `curl`, but you may need to use the package manager of their distribution (e.g. `sudo apt-get install curl`)
* MacOS comes shipped with `curl`

You can test whether it works by going to a Terminal window, or to the Command Prompt and executing: `curl -L -H "Accept: text/turtle" "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Inside_Out_(2015_film)"`

Did you see any triples?


### 6.3 IPython Notebook (Jupyter)

Interactive notebooks are simple and effective tools for testing small bits of your code before you integrate it in a larger application.

Run `pip install jupyter` in a Terminal or the Command Prompt.

Jupyter documentation is here:  <http://jupyter.readthedocs.org>.

### 6.4 Virtualenv
If you don't yet have it, it may be a good idea to install the `virtualenv` package. The advantage of using `virtualenv` is that this creates a nicely self-contained Python environment in which you can install the packages needed for your application. This way your global environment does not get clogged, and you avoid potential incompatibilities between different Python projects.

Run `pip install virtualenv` in a Terminal or the Command Prompt.

Have a look at the `virtualenv` page at the [Hitchhikers Guide to Python](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/) for a good description of how you should work with virtual environments.

* `pip` is shipped with Python. If Windows complains that it cannot find it, you should add the folder `C:\Python27\Scripts` to the system wide `PATH` environment variable, see above.
* If, when installing `virtualenv`, your system complains that a directory is not writable, try running `sudo pip install virtualenv` (on Windows: right click the Command Prompt icon, and select `Run as Administrator`, then run `pip install virtualenv`)

### 6.5 Git
The **git** version control system for your platform of choice. Version control is very important when collaboratively developing code. You could also use Dropbox or equivalent, but these systems do not prevent conflicting copies. Git is the most modern version control mechanism that is currently in use by millions of developers, and [GitHub](http://github.com) is the online cloud service of choice.

Try and learn [here](http://try.github.io) why and how you should use it.

* Windows users can go to <https://git-scm.com> to download it
* Linux users should use the package manager of their system (e.g. `sudo apt-get install git`)
* MacOS users can most easily install it with Homebrew (`brew install git`) or download it from <https://git-scm.com>
* Note: it makes sense to also install a UI-based application, such as [SourceTree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com).

### 6.6 TopBraid Composer

* Download TopBraid Free Edition from <http://www.topquadrant.com/downloads/topbraid-composer-install/>.
* The Standard and Maestro Editions can be evaluated for a limited period.
* Unzip the downloaded file, and move the folder it creates to a location of your choice (e.g. `/Applications` on MacOS, or `C:\Program Files` on Windows systems).
* To run it: double click the `TopBraid Composer` executable file inside the folder.
* It will ask you for a 'Workspace' directory: this should be an existing directory which will be the **parent** directory of any RDF/OWL projects you are planning to start.
* After TopBraid has started, you can get started by creating a new project by right-clicking in the "Navigator" panel (bottom right, by default).
* Make sure to synchronise the workspace after you make any changes to the files inside your project form outside of the Eclipse environment.

### 6.7 A Standalone Reasoner
You can use the Stardog triple store for running inverences (see below), but sometimes it is useful to be able to run a classifier against a local ontology/RDF file. We have a Pellet build [avialable on Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/s/sugzmjq91ggsney/pellet.tar.gz?dl=0) that you can use. Pellet is by the same developers as Stardog. See <https://github.com/Complexible/pellet> for licensing information.

After downloading, unzip the file, and move the resulting directory to a location of your choice.

You can run Pellet from your Terminal or Command Prompt window by running `./pellet.sh` or `pellet.bat` (on Windows). On Mac/Linux systems make sure to set the permissions to executable on this file: `chmod u+x pellet.sh`.

Running `./pellet.sh help` will give you basic usage information. There's also a readme.

### 6.8 Linked Data Reactor (LD-R) Framework
[LD-R](http://ld-r.org) is a framework for building reactive component-based Linked Data Applications.
LD-R utilizes Facebook's ReactJS components, Flux architecture and Yahoo!'s Fluxible framework for implementing isomorphic Semantic Web applications.
Follow [this quick tutorial](http://ld-r.org/docs/basicTutorial.html) to install and use LD-R.
