American celebrities such as Nina Simone, Langston Hughes, and Lionel Hampton went on AMSAC’s fully sponsored trip to strengthen African-American/African connections. The performances and AMSAC’s image-building will be examined through photographs of the Lagos festival. These photographs are records of staged acts – acts that were meant to generate positive images of Black America and to reinforce (unequal) power relations between Nigerians and (Black) Americans. The visit of the group provides an interesting case study on the intersecting histories of the Cold War, the American Civil Rights Movement and the decolonisation of the African continent.",

  title     = "The Global Water Grabbing Syndrome",
  abstract  = "Large-scale acquisitions of agricultural land in developing countries have been rapidly increasing in the last 10 years, contributing to a major agrarian transition from subsistence or small scale farming to large-scale com- mercial agriculture by agribusiness transnational corporations. Likely driven by recent food crises, new bioenergy policies, and financial speculations, this phenomenon has been often investigated from the economic develop- ment, human right, land tenure and food security perspectives, while its hydrologic implications have remained understudied. It has been suggested that a major driver of large-scale land acquisitions (LSLAs) is the quest for water resources that can be used (locally) to sustain agricultural production in the acquired land. The appropri- ation of water resources associated with LSLAs has often been termed ‘water grabbing’, though to date a formal definition of such a normative and inherently pejorative term is missing. The intrinsic assumption is that the ac- quisition of water undergoes the same dynamics of unbalanced power relationships that underlie many LSLAs. Here we invoke hydrological theories of “green” and “blue” water flows to stress the extent to which water ap- propriations are inherently coupled to land acquisitions and specifically focus on blue water. We then propose a formal definition of blue water grabbing based both on biophysical conditions (water scarcity) and ethical impli- cations (human right to food). Blue water grabs are appropriations of irrigation (i.e., blue) water in regions affect- ed by undernourishment and where agricultural production is constrained by blue water availability. We use this framework to provide a global assessment of the likelihood that LSLAs entail blue water grabbing.",

The key idea of the new metaheuristic is to perform a random number of random-sized jumps in random order through four well-known local search operators. Computational testing on the 600 large-scale benchmarks of Bräysy et al. (Expert Syst Appl 36(4):8460–8475, 2009) show that the new metaheuristic outperforms previous best approaches, finding 533 new best-known solutions. Despite the significant number of random components, it is demonstrated that the variance of the results is rather low. Moreover, the suggested metaheuristic is shown to scale almost linearly up to 1000 customers.",

The deficiency of these methods is slow local search based hill climbing that often is restricted to limited local neighborhood. In this paper we suggest a novel new two-phase metaheuristic that escapes the local minima with jumps of varying size, instead of step by step local hill climbing. The initial solution is first generated with a powerful ejection pool heuristic. The key idea of the improvement phase is to combine large neighborhood search with standard guided local search metaheuristic in a novel way, allowing improved search diversification and escape from local minima in more efficient way through jumps. The algorithm has been tested on the standard Gehring and Homberger benchmarks for the vehicle routing problem with time windows and the results indicate very competitive performance. We found 12 new and 43 matched best-known solutions and the best overall results for all problem sizes at comparable computation times.",

Here we report Sm-Nd isotope data from 26 individual garnet inclusions from 26 harzburgitic diamonds from Venetia, South Africa. Garnet inclusions and host diamonds comprise two compositional suites formed under markedly different conditions and define two isochrons, one Archaean (2.95 Ga) and one Proterozoic (1.15 Ga). The Archaean diamond suite formed from relatively cool fluid-dominated metasomatism during rifting of the southern shelf of the Zimbabwe Craton. The 1.8 billion years younger Proterozoic diamond suite formed by melt-dominated metasomatism related to the 1.1 Ga Umkondo Large Igneous Province. The results demonstrate that resolving the time of diamond growth events requires dating of individual inclusions, and that there was a major change in the magmatic processes responsible for harzburgitic diamond formation beneath Venetia from the Archaean to the Proterozoic.",

  abstract  = "Thermal paper contains potentially toxic additives, such as bisphenol A (BPA), as a common color developer. Because of its known endocrine disrupting effects, structural analogues to BPA, such as bisphenol S (BPS), D-8 and Pergafast 201, have been used as alternatives, but little is known about the presence and toxicological effects of alternatives other than BPS. In this study, thermal paper is screened by direct probe ambient mass spectrometry (rapid pre-screening method not requiring sample preparation) and by liquid chromatography (LC) with high resolution time-of flight (TOF-MS) mass spectrometry. Cash receipts and other thermal paper products (cinema tickets, boarding passes and luggage tags) were analyzed. Besides BPA and BPS, other developers only recently reported (Pergafast 201, D-8) or to the best of our knowledge not reported before (D-90, TGSA, BPS-MAE) were frequently found as well as some related unreported impurities (2,4-BPS that is a BPS related impurity and a TGSA related impurity). To gain some insight into the potential estrogenicity of the detected developers, a selection of extracts was further analyzed using a LC-nanofractionation platform in combination with cell-based bioassay testing. These preliminary results seems to indicate very low or absence of estrogenic activity for Pergafast 201, D-8, D-90, TGSA and BPS-MAE in comparison to BPA and BPS, although further dose-response tests with authentic standards are required to confirm these results. Compounds for which standards were available were also tested for developmental toxicity and neurotoxicity using zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos. TGSA and D-8 induced similar teratogenic effects as BPA in zebrafish embryos. BPS and 2,4-BPS did not induce any developmental effects but 2,4-BPS did alter the locomotor activity at the tested concentration. Our findings suggest that the alternatives used as alternatives to BPA (except BPS) might not be estrogenic. However, TGSA and D-8 showed abnormal developmental effects similar to BPA.",

Moreover, genetically-identical cells exhibit variability (noise) in protein expression, arising from the stochastic nature of biochemical processes, cell growth and division. While it is well understood how cellular growth rate influences mean protein expression, little is known about the relationship between growth rate and noise in protein expression. Here we quantify this relationship in Bacillus subtilis by a novel combination of experiments and theory. We measure the effects of promoter activity and growth rate on the expression of a fluorescent protein in single cells. We disentangle the observed protein expression noise into protein-specific and systemic contributions, using theory and variance decomposition. We find that noise in protein expression depends solely on mean expression levels, regardless of whether expression is set by promoter activity or growth rate, and that noise increases linearly with growth rate. Our results can aid studies of (synthetic) gene circuits of single cells and their condition dependence.",

  abstract  = "Directing our gaze towards a moving target has two known advantages for judging its trajectory: the spatial resolution with which the target is seen is maximized, and signals related to the eyes' movements are combined with retinal cues to better judge the target's motion. We here explore whether tracking a target with one's eyes also prevents factors that are known to give rise to systematic errors in judging retinal speeds from resulting in systematic errors in interception. Subjects intercepted white or patterned disks that moved from left to right across a large screen at various constant velocities while either visually tracking the target or fixating the position at which they were required to intercept the target. We biased retinal motion perception by moving the pattern within the patterned targets. This manipulation led to large systematic errors in interception when subjects were fixating, but not when they were tracking the target. The reduction in the errors did not depend on how smoothly the eyes were tracking the target shortly before intercepting it. We propose that tracking targets with one's eyes when one wants to intercept them makes one less susceptible to biases in judging their motion.",

  abstract  = "Through their semi-natural and agricultural areas, peri-urban regions are pivotal in providing ecosystem services (ES) to city dwellers. To quantify the ES provided by these areas, it is possible to use ES mapping methods: many ES mapping methods rely on land cover maps, but most maps are coarse compared to the peri-urban scale. Nevertheless, readily-available land use data and methods are often used to map ES at such scales, without contextualisation. As a result, such methods may not be able to capture the diversity that is present in the peri-urban vegetation, which could have consequences for their accuracy and furthermore for urban planning policies. To increase our understanding of the applicability of ES mapping methods in peri-urban regions, we assessed to what degree sites with similar plant composition in the green belt of Paris, France, were also projected to have similar ES bundles. We considered two commonly used ES model types: proxy-based models (here: look-up tables) and phenomenological models. We used 252 sites for which botanical survey data were available and applied the ES models to seven ES relevant in the peri-urban context. A cluster analysis was used to group sites, hence facilitating analyse of the spatial congruence between types of vegetation and bundles of ES. Clustering sites based on plant composition revealed six distinct clusters. Clustering sites based on ES bundles as estimated by phenomenological models and proxy-based models, resulted in four and two clusters, respectively. The proxy-based clustering only highlighted broad-leaved forests as an important ES supply source. The phenomenological model estimates of ES allowed a more nuanced clustering of sites into four different groups. The level of congruence between the different sets of clusters based on plant composition and estimated ES bundles was low. Except for forests, the commonly used ES models tested here were not able to represent the same level of heterogeneity in the peri-urban landscape as was found in the vegetation. Our results demonstrate the need to integrate finer scale approaches and primary data in ES assessments of peri-urban areas.",

  abstract  = "Land cover is one of the most important conditioning factors in landslide susceptibility analysis. Usually it is considered as a static factor, but it has proven to be dynamic, with changes occurring even in few decades. In this work the influence of land cover changes on landslide susceptibility are analyzed for the past and for future scenarios. For the application, an area representative of the hilly-low mountain sectors of the Italian Southern Apennines was chosen (Rivo basin, in Molise Region). With this purpose landslide inventories and land cover maps were produced for the years 1954, 1981 and 2007. Two alternative future scenarios were created for 2050, one which follows the past trend (2050-trend), and another one more extreme, foreseeing a decrease of forested and cultivated areas (2050-alternative). The landslide susceptibility analysis was performed using the Spatial Multi-Criteria Evaluation method for different time steps, investigating changes to susceptibility over time.The results show that environmental dynamics, such as land cover change, affect slope stability in time. In fact there is a decrease of susceptibility in the past and in the future 2050-trend scenario. This is due to the increase of forest or cultivated areas, that is probably determined by a better land management, water and soil control respect to other land cover types such as shrubland, pasture or bareland. Conversely the results revealed by the alternative scenario (2050-alternative), show how the decrease in forest and cultivated areas leads to an increase in landslide susceptibility. This can be related to the assumed worst climatic condition leading to a minor agricultural activity and lower extension of forested areas, possibly associated also to the effects of forest fires. The results suggest that conscious landscape management might contribute to determine a significant reduction in landslide susceptibility.",

For example, a desire for eating can be triggered by a need for food such as hungriness or it can be triggered by seeing tempting food. Humans often apply various desire regulation strategies to control their desires. Persons with poor desire regulation may suffer regarding their health, e.g., from overweight and obesity. Desire regulation can make use of different regulation strategies; this implies an underlying decision making process, which makes use of some form of self-monitoring. The aim of this work is to develop a neurologically inspired computational cognitive model of desire regulation and these underlying self-monitoring and decision making processes. In this model four desire regulation strategies have been incorporated. A self-monitoring mechanism continuously monitors and assesses the desire level and based on this a decision mechanism performs the selection of one or multiple strategies, depending on personality characteristics. Simulation experiments have been performed based for the domain of food choice.",

The presented computational model simulates the dynamics of mental states of a human during formation and change of behaviour. The application domain focuses on sustainable behavior. In addition, this model shows the role of short-term advertisements to propagate forming long-term behaviours and habits to a more sustainable lifestyle. The model is based on a Network-Oriented Modeling approach as a temporal-casual network of mental states and behaviours, which is in accordance with psychological literature.

  abstract  = "The increasing trend in the consumption of various materials has also led to a huge increase in the final waste streams especially in the form of municipal solid waste (MSW) and the consequent environmental pollutions in particular greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. These have made MSW management a significant environmental issue for governments and policy-makers. To address these challenges, developed countries have implemented sustainable material management (SMM) strategies which have been comprehensively reviewed herein. Moreover, waste generation statistics reported for most of the developed and developing countries as well as the existing gaps in MSW management among these countries have been fully discussed. The present paper was also aimed at comprehensively assessing electricity generation potentials from MSW using an integrated solid waste management system (including three different technologies of anaerobic digestion (AD), incineration, and pyrolysis-gasification) while the consequent GHG emission reduction potentials as a result of their implementation were also explored. To facilitate the understanding of the potential impacts of these treatment strategies, Iran's data were used as a case study. More specifically, the theoretical and technical potentials of electricity generation were calculated and the GHG emission reduction potentials were estimated using a life cycle assessment (LCA) approach. Overall, it was found that 5005.4–5545.8 GW h of electricity could be generated from MSW in Iran annually which could lead to approximately 3561–4844 thousand tons of avoided CO2eq. Such GHG reductions would be translated into approximately 0.5% of Iran's annual GHG emissions and would be considered a promising achievement given Iran's international GHGs reduction commitment, i.e., 4% reduction of anthropogenic GHGs emissions by 2030 below the business as usual scenario. Such findings could also be modeled for the other developing countries around the world where efficient MSW management is yet to be implemented.",

  abstract  = "mMarine and estuarine ecosystems are highly productive areas that often act as a final sink for several pollutants, such as cadmium. Environmental conditions in these habitats can affect metal speciation, as well as its uptake and depuration by living organisms. The aim of this study was to assess cadmium uptake and depuration rates in the euryhaline calanoid copepod Acartia tonsa under different pH, salinity and temperature conditions. Cadmium speciation did not vary with changing pH or temperature, but varied with salinity. Free Cd2+ ion activity increased with decreasing salinities resulting in increased cadmium concentrations in A. tonsa. However, uptake rate, derived using free Cd2+ ion activity, showed no significant differences at different salinities indicating a simultaneous combined effect of Cd2+ speciation and metabolic rates for osmoregulation. Cadmium concentration in A. tonsa and uptake rate increased with increasing pH, showing a peak at the intermediate pH of 7.5, while depuration rate fluctuated, thus suggesting that both parameters are mediated by metabolic processes (to maintain homeostasis at pH levels lower than normal) and ion competition at membrane binding sites. Cadmium concentration in A. tonsa, uptake and depuration rates increased with increasing temperature, a trend that can be attributed to an increase in metabolic energy demand at higher temperatures. The present study shows that cadmium uptake and depuration rates in the marine copepod A. tonsa is mostly affected by biological processes, mainly driven by metabolic mechanisms, and to a lesser extent by metal speciation in the exposure medium.",

  title     = "The low single nucleotide polymorphism heritability of plasma and saliva cortisol levels",
  abstract  = "Cortisol is an important stress hormone affected by a variety of biological and environmental factors, such as the circadian rhythm, exercise and psychological stress. Cortisol is mostly measured using blood or saliva samples. A number of genetic variants have been found to contribute to cortisol levels with these methods. While the effects of several specific single genetic variants is known, the joint genome-wide contribution to cortisol levels is unclear. Our aim was to estimate the amount of cortisol variance explained by common single nucleotide polymorphisms, i.e. the SNP heritability, using a variety of cortisol measures, cohorts and analysis approaches. We analyzed morning plasma (n=5705) and saliva levels (n=1717), as well as diurnal saliva levels (n=1541), in the Rotterdam Study using genomic restricted maximum likelihood estimation. Additionally, linkage disequilibrium score regression was fitted on the results of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) performed by the CORNET consortium on morning plasma cortisol (n=12,597) and saliva cortisol (n=7703). No significant SNP heritability was detected for any cortisol measure, sample or analysis approach. Point estimates ranged from 0% to 9%. Morning plasma cortisol in the CORNET cohorts, the sample with the most power, had a 6% [95%CI: 0-13%] SNP heritability. The results consistently suggest a low SNP heritability of these acute and short-term measures of cortisol. The low SNP heritability may reflect the substantial environmental and, in particular, situational component of these cortisol measures. Future GWAS will require very large sample sizes. Alternatively, more long-term cortisol measures such as hair cortisol samples are needed to discover further genetic pathways regulating cortisol concentrations.",

  abstract  = "Large scale landfarming experiments, using an extensive range of treatments, were conducted in the Niger-Delta, Nigeria to study the degradation of oil in contaminated soils. In this work the effect of nutrient addition, biosurfactant, Eisenia fetida (earthworm) enzyme extract, bulking and sorption agents and soil neutralization were tested. It was found that these treatments were successful in removing up to 53% of the total petroleum hydrocarbon in the soil within 16 weeks. A comparison between treatments demonstrated that most were no more effective than agricultural fertilizer addition alone. One strategy that did show better performance was a combination of nutrients, biochar and biosurfactant, which was found to remove 23% more Total Petroleum Hydrocarbons (TPH) than fertilizer alone. However, when performance normalized costs were considered, this treatment became less attractive as a remedial option. Based on this same analysis it was concluded that fertilizer only was the most cost effective treatment. As a consequence, it is recommended that fertilizer is used to enhance the landfarming of hydrocarbon contaminated soils in the Niger Delta. The attenuation rates of both bulk TPH and Total Petroleum Hydrocarbon Criteria Working Group (TPHCWG) fractions are also provided. These values represent one of the first large scale and scientifically tested datasets for treatment of contaminated soil in the Niger Delta region. An inverse correlation between attenuation rates and hydrocarbon molecular weight was observed with heavy fractions showing much slower degradation rates than lighter fractions. Despite this difference, the bioremediation process resulted in significant removal of all TPH compounds independent of carbon number.",

Previous findings suggest, however, that besides political orientation, ideological strength (i.e., political extremism) is also relevant to understand such distinctive attitudes. Our study reveals that the political right is more anxious, and the political left experiences more self-efficacy, about the refugee crisis. At the same time, the political extremes—at both sides of the spectrum—are more likely than moderates to believe that the solution to this societal problem is simple. Furthermore, both extremes experience more judgmental certainty about their domain-specific knowledge of the refugee crisis, independent of their actual knowledge. Finally, belief in simple solutions mediated the relationship between ideology and judgmental certainty, but only among political extremists. We conclude that both ideological orientation and strength matter to understand citizens’ reactions to the refugee crisis.",

The samples at 2000 ft and 4000 ft were recorded at a countryside road, a 360° photo of which was used for the virtual visuals. The other two CDA samples were derived from the recording at 4000 ft. Participants were asked to rate all flyover samples twice while being immersed in the virtual environment. The CDA at 3000 ft was rated as most annoying, likely due to a longer overflight duration, followed by the regular descent and then the CDAs at 4000 and 5000 ft. As CDAs follow a fairly steady trajectory, it was estimated that they will increase annoyance within an area of approximately 2.5 km2, as compared to regular landings. Outside of this area, CDAs may instead result in less annoyance than regular landings.",

  title     = "Overweight is associated with lower resting state functional connectivity in females after eliminating genetic effects: A twin study",
  abstract  = "Obesity is related to altered functional connectivity of resting state brain networks that are involved in reward and motivation. It is unknown to what extent these associations reflect genetic confounding and whether the obesity-related connectivity changes are associated with differences in dietary intake. In this study, resting state functional MRI was performed after an overnight fast in 16 female monozygotic twin pairs (aged 48.8 ± 9.8 years) with a mean BMI discordance of 3.96 ± 2.1 kg/m(2) (range 0.7-8.2). Functional connectivity of the salience, basal ganglia, default mode and anterior cingulate-orbitofrontal cortex networks was examined by independent component analysis. Dietary intake was assessed using 3-day 24-hour recalls. Results revealed that within the basal ganglia network, heavier versus leaner co-twins have decreased functional connectivity strength in bilateral putamen (P < 0.05, FWE-corrected). There were no differences in connectivity in the other networks examined. In the overall group, lower functional connectivity strength in the left putamen was correlated with higher intake of total fat (P < 0.01). It was concluded that, after eliminating genetic effects, overweight is associated with lower resting state functional connectivity in bilateral putamen in the basal ganglia network. The association between lower putamen connectivity and higher fat intake suggests an important role of the putamen in appetitive mechanisms. The cross-sectional nature of our study cannot discriminate cause and consequence, but the findings are compatible with an effect of lower putamen connectivity on increased BMI and associated higher fat intake.

  abstract  = "Background Accurate fall screening tools are needed to identify those multiple sclerosis (MS) patients at high risk of falling. The present study aimed at determining the validity of a series of performance-based measures (PBMs) of lower extremity functions and patient-reported outcomes (PROs) in predicting falls in a sample of MS patients (n = 84), who were ambulatory independent. Methods Patients were assessed using the following PBMs: timed up and go (TUG), timed 25-foot walk (T25FW), cognitive T25FW, 2-min walk (2MW), and cognitive 2MW. Moreover, a series of valid and reliable PROs were filled in by participants including the activities-specific balance confidence (ABC), 12-item multiple sclerosis walking scale (MSWS-12), fall efficacy scale international (FES-I), and modified fatigue impact scale (MFIS). The dual task cost (DTC) of 2MW and T25FW tests were calculated as a percentage of change in parameters from single to dual task conditions. Participants were classified as none-fallers and fallers (⩾1) based on their prospective fall occurrence. Results In the present study, 41(49%) participants recorded ≥ 1 fall and were classified as fallers. The results of logistic regression analysis revealed that each individual test, except DTC of 2MW and T25FW, significantly predicted future falls. However, considering the area under the curves (AUCs), PROs were more accurate compared to PBMs. In addition, the results of multiple logistic regression with the first two factors extracted from principal component analysis revealed that both factor 1 (PROs) and factor 2 (PBMs) significantly predicted falls with a greater odds ratio (OR) for factor 1 (factor 1: P = <0.0001, OR = 63.41 (6.72–597.90)) than factor 2 (P <0.05, OR = 5.03 (1.33–18.99)). Conclusions The results of this study can be used by clinicians to identify and monitor potential fallers in MS patients.",

Regular participation in moderate-to-vigorous exercise activities during leisure time was assessed by survey. Parental education was dichotomized ({"}both parents with a low education{"} vs {"}at least one parent with a high education{"}). The mean in exercise behavior tended to be higher and the variance tended to be lower in children of high educated parents. Evidence for gene-by-environment interaction was weak.

  title     = "CXCR4-Specific Nanobodies as Potential Therapeutics for WHIM syndrome",
  abstract  = "WHIM syndrome is a rare congenital immunodeficiency disease, named after its main clinical manifestations: warts, hypogammaglobulinemia, infections, and myelokathexis, which refers to abnormal accumulation of mature neutrophils in the bone marrow. The disease is primarily caused by C-terminal truncation mutations of the chemokine receptor CXCR4, giving these CXCR4-WHIM mutants a gain of function in response to their ligand CXCL12. Considering the broad functions of CXCR4 in maintaining leukocyte homeostasis, patients are panleukopenic and display altered immune responses, likely as a consequence of impairment in the differentiation and trafficking of leukocytes. Treatment of WHIM patients currently consists of symptom relief, leading to unsatisfactory clinical responses. As an alternative and potentially more effective approach, we tested the potency and efficacy of CXCR4-specific nanobodies on inhibiting CXCR4-WHIM mutants. Nanobodies are therapeutic proteins based on the smallest functional fragments of heavy chain antibodies. They combine the advantages of small-molecule drugs and antibody-based therapeutics due to their relative small size, high stability, and high affinity. We compared the potential of monovalent and bivalent CXCR4-specific nanobodies to inhibit CXCL12-induced CXCR4-WHIM-mediated signaling with the small-molecule clinical candidate AMD3100. The CXCR4-targeting nanobodies displace CXCL12 binding and bind CXCR4-wild type and CXCR4-WHIM (R334X/S338X) mutants and with (sub-) nanomolar affinities. The nanobodies' epitope was mapped to extracellular loop 2 of CXCR4, overlapping with the binding site of CXCL12. Monovalent, and in particular bivalent, nanobodies were more potent than AMD3100 in reducing CXCL12-mediated G protein activation. In addition, CXCR4-WHIM-dependent calcium flux and wound healing of human papillomavirus-immortalized cell lines in response to CXCL12 was effectively inhibited by the nanobodies. Based on these in vitro results, we conclude that CXCR4 nanobodies hold significant potential as alternative therapeutics for CXCR4-associated diseases such as WHIM syndrome.",

  title     = "Governing for resilience: the role of institutional work",
  abstract  = "Resilience has become a key concept in the sciences and practices of environmental governance. Yet governing for resilience is a major challenge because it requires governance systems to be both stable and flexible at the same time. Achieving a productive balance between stability and flexibility is a key challenge. The concept of {"}institutional work{"} is a promising lens for analysing the dynamic tension between stability and flexibility in governance systems. It refers to actions through which actors create, maintain, or disrupt institutional structures. The paper explains the concept of institutional work and shows how it usefully integrates several emerging lines of study regarding agency in governance, which have so far remained separate. Overall, the concept of institutional work opens up novel opportunities for analysing the interactions between actors and institutional structures that produce stability and flexibility in governance systems.",

  abstract  = "Since the 1950s the amount of plastics in the marine environment has increased dramatically. Worldwide there is a growing concern about the risks and possible adverse effects of (micro)plastics. This paper reflects on the sources and effects of marine litter and the effects of policies and other actions taken worldwide. Current knowledge offers a solid basis for effective action. Yet, so far the effects of policies and other initiatives are still largely insufficient. The search for appropriate responses could be based on possible interventions and profound understanding of the context specific factors for success. Moreover, the scope, timeframe and dynamics of all initiatives are distinctly different and orchestration at all levels, in close cooperation with one another, is currently lacking.",

  abstract  = "Using country-level data from 2003–2014, we examine the association between auditing level (measured as number of verification actions taken by tax authorities per 100 taxpayers in each country) and tax compliance (measured as business executives’ perception of tax evasion). Our hypothesis is that compliance increases until a certain auditing level is reached, and decreases beyond that level (i.e., an elevated auditing level backfires). In line with our expectation, the results of a series of tests indicate that there is a U-shaped association between auditing and tax evasion. We discuss how a potential backfiring effect may depend on the extent to which compliance is voluntary.",
