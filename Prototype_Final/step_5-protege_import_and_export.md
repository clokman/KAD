It is recommended to...

1 - Import all ontologies to Protege (and not just open them) 

2 - (Optionally) Run the reasoner to check for any problems 

3 - GATHER ONTOLOGIES (under 'File' menu). This allows Protege to format and compact ontologoies, and possibly add some possibly missing triples (e.g., regarding to basic class definitions not mentioned in these scripts, etcâ€”this needs to be confirmed, but to be on the safe side, is recommended).
